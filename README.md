# BizzAppDev Systems - Python Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various programming problems implemented in Python. Each problem is solved in a separate file with a clear problem definition and approach description.

## Repository Structure

- `01_bank_transaction_analyzer.py`: A simple bank transaction system simulation
- `02_task_scheduling_problem.py`: Algorithm to schedule tasks based on deadlines and durations
- `03_date_difference_calculator.py`: Calculate days lived based on birthdate
- `04_electricity_bill_calculator.py`: Calculate electricity bills with tiered pricing
- `05_inventory_matching_pricing.py`: Check order fulfillment based on inventory and budget
- `06_reverse_counting_recursion.py`: Recursive function to count down from a number
- `07_separate_and_sort.py`: Separate and sort letters and digits in a string

## How to Run

Each Python file can be run independently. For example:

```bash
python 01_bank_transaction_analyzer.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Standard Python libraries (no external dependencies)

## Problem Descriptions

Each file contains a detailed problem description and approach at the top of the file as comments. The solutions demonstrate various programming concepts including:

- Data structures and algorithms
- Input validation and error handling
- Business logic implementation
- String manipulation
- Date and time operations
- Recursion
- Optimization techniques
